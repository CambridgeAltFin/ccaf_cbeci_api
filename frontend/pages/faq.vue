Anyone who wants to participate in the vote (<strong>miners</strong>) needs to prove that they performed some &ldquo;work&rdquo; &ndash; hence the term <strong>proof-of-work</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>This work consists of finding the solution to a cryptographic puzzle, which in simplistic terms can be thought of as guessing a random number. The only way of finding the random number — called a <strong>nonce</strong> in technical jargon — is to brute force all possible options. This way, the work cannot be faked but is trivial to verify by other network participants once the winning nonce has been revealed.</p><p>Solving the PoW requires substantial computing power depending on the difficulty level: the more miners join the race, the more difficult the puzzle becomes. Rather than guessing numbers manually, miners operate specialised mining equipment (ASICs) that has been specifically designed to be very good at only one single task — solving the PoW.&nbsp;</p><p>Miners need to incur financial costs in the form of <strong>capital expenditures</strong> (acquiring mining hardware) as well as <strong>operational expenditures</strong> (spending electricity to run and cool the machines). Miners are in constant competition between themselves: whoever finds the solution to the puzzle first obtains the right to add his block to the global ledger. In return, the successful miner gets rewarded for his efforts with newly minted bitcoin.&nbsp;</p><p>In the event that two valid but competing blocks are found at roughly the same time by different miners, the chain will split into two branches. Network participants will always follow the &ldquo;longest&rdquo; chain, that is the branch that was most difficult to produce (i.e. required more computing power, and was thus more expensive to generate). The idea is that miners should have a <strong>financial incentive</strong> to play by the rules as they stand to gain more from being honest than if they were to cheat.</p><p>Or, in the words of anonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto:</p><p><em>[A greedy attacker] ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.</em><sup> 1</sup></p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p><sup>1 </sup><sub>Satoshi Nakamoto (2008) <em>Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.</em> Available at: <a href='https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf'target='_blank'>https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf</a></sub></p>"

However, more machines also means that more electricity is needed to run and cool the equipment, which in turn results in higher costs for the miner in question. Miners are thus always searching for abundant electricity sources at the lowest possible price.</p><p>While newer ASIC models are substantially more energy-efficient than previous generations, they still consume a significant amount of electricity. Rising bitcoin prices make mining more attractive, as the potential reward increases in value. As a result, new mining hardware will get added to the network and lead to increasing electricity consumption overall.</p><p>The electricity consumption is thus closely linked to total mining revenues (block subsidy and transaction fees), which are a function of the Bitcoin price.</p>"

It is also difficult to determine what hardware miners are using as profitability may vary significantly from one region to another because of different electricity costs.</p><p>Moreover, mining operations require additional electricity to cool the machines to prevent them from overheating, and eventually breaking. Data centres can vary significantly in terms of how efficiently they use electricity: while cooling and overheads for the most efficient facilities account for less than 2% of the electricity used to run the mining equipment, less efficient data centres can have significantly higher figures. It is not possible to exactly determine how efficiently mining facilities use electricity as they are located in different regions and have different configurations and settings.</p><p>The best option is thus to build theoretical models based on specific assumptions (see the <a href='https://cbeci.org/methodology'target='_blank'>Methodology</a> section) in order to provide an educated guess.
